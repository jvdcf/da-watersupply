As part of the first project of Algorithm Design, the goal was to develop a tool to aid in making informed decisions regarding the management of a water supply network. The tool provides insights on the amount of water that can be supplied to each city, identifies sensitive sections of the network that are prone to failures, and more.

This project was carried out by students from group 163\+:

The project was developed in C++ and uses the CMake tool to compile the source code and this documentation. ~\newline


This program takes as input a path to a directory containing 4 csv files with the following names\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Cities.\+csv}
\item {\ttfamily Pipes.\+csv}
\item {\ttfamily Reservoir.\+csv}
\item {\ttfamily Stations.\+csv}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Make sure that the csv files are in the correct format and that the directory path is correct before executing.

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} The csv files can have different names, for example\+: {\ttfamily Reservoir.\+csv} can be named {\ttfamily Reservoirs\+\_\+\+Madeira.\+csv}. Despite this, it is recommended to keep the original names. \end{quote}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Make sure that the C / C++ dependencies are installed on your system.
\item Execute the script {\ttfamily run.\+sh} (located in the directory of the project) in the terminal.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} The script assumes that the csv files are in the folder {\ttfamily dataset/\+Large\+Data\+Set} and their names were not changed. ~\newline
 Feel free to change the script to suit your needs. \end{quote}

\item Open the project folder in CLion.
\item Create a CMake profile with the build type set to {\ttfamily Release}.
\item Select the configuration {\ttfamily DA2324\+\_\+\+PRJ1\+\_\+\+G163} already created. ~\newline
 {\itshape or} ~\newline
 Create a new configuration with the correct program arguments and working directory. ~\newline
 For example\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Program arguments\+: {\ttfamily dataset/\+Large\+Data\+Set}
\item Working directory\+: {\ttfamily \$Project\+File\+Dir\$}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Run the configuration.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Certain commands may require extended execution time in {\ttfamily Debug} build mode. Ensure the build mode is set to {\ttfamily Release} prior to running the program.
\item The integrated terminal in CLion may exhibit different behavior compared to the system terminal. It is recommended to use the system terminal for running the program when feasible.
